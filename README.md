# DGMD E-17 SAR Drone
The adoption of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology presents a promising avenue for reducing human exposure to hazardous scenarios, particularly in search and rescue (SAR) missions. Effectively locating disaster victims or targets in rescue missions requires sophisticated UAV capabilities, including navigation and identification in diverse weather conditions. This project focuses on developing a deep reinforcement learning model tailored for path planning, integrating it with a simulation environment, and deploying it on a drone equipped with customized hardware.

The project leveraged a deep Q network from deep reinforcement learning (RL) and the RRT algorithm from classical path planning studies. It also explored the capabilities of YOLOv5 for object detection tasks. Simulation environments were created using ArduPilot and QGroundControl, enabling rigorous testing and refinement of the path planning algorithms. Practical validation involved executing test flights using a DJI Mini 2 drone with a specialized hardware payload. The findings of this project demonstrate the feasibility of these technologies in a proof-of-concept setting, laying a foundation for future advancements in autonomous SAR missions.
